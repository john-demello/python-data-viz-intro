An introduction to data visualisation and analysis using Python
-------

These Jupyter notebooks form the basis of a course on data analysis and visualization taught at the [Chemistry Department of Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry) as part of the first year undergraduate curriculum.
The purpose of the course is to introduce the basic data analysis techniques required to interpret experimental (or otherwise) data collected in the laboratory, along with introducing the Jupyter notebook as an electronic, multi-media, interactive computing notebook that students are encouraged to use throughout their degree.

Whilst the focus of the course is not computer programming, it could serve as a pre-introduction to the subject. It introduces variables, data structures in the form of arrays, functions, and more generally a computing platform.

The course was designed as a series of self-learning interactive exercises using Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel.
The first four notebooks mostly introduce concepts interactively while the last two notebooks develop problem solving based on these concepts.
